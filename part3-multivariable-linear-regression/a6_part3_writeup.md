# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
0.86. this says there is a stronger correlation in the model, more than the other examples.

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
think so, compared to the other models this one has a higher correlation.

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
10 year car is predicted to be 8873,27 and for the 20 year car it was predicted to be 1659.25.


4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
the higher the age and milage, the care isn't profitable anymore.
